#MORE TO DO:
#
#1) create Game logic class:
    # create hands
    # choose_winner
    #
    #
    # choose_winner:
    #   if h1 or h1 is straight_flush
    #     if both
    #       winner is hand with highest response.value
    #     else
    #       one of them is the winner
    #
    #   elsif h1 or h2 is four_of_a_kind
    #     if both
    #       winner is hand with highest response.value
    #     else
    #       one of them is the winner
    #
    #   elsif h1 or h2 is full_house
    #     if both
    #       winner is hand with highest response.value
    #     else
    #       one of them is the winner
    #
    #   elsif h1 or h2 is flush
    #     if both
    #       winner is hand with highest high_card
    #     else
    #       one of them is the winner
    #
    #   elsif h1 or h2 is straight
    #     if both
    #       winner is hand with highest response.value
    #     else
    #       one of them is the winner
    #
    #   elsif h1 or h2 is two_pairs
    #     ...
    #   elsif h1 or h2 is pair
    #     ...
    #   else
    #     call High Card function
#
#2) create high card function in hand class
      #function(other_hand)
      # h1_ranks = self.ranks
      # h2_ranks = other_hand.ranks
      #
      # pop sorted arrays together, and compare, winner is highest
#
#3) create function in card to map ranks to letters
      #function()
      # if rank >= 9, return letter T,J,Q,K,A accordingly
#
#5) ensure hand only allowed to have 5 cards
#6) tests
